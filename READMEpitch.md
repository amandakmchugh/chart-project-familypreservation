How State Spending on Family Preservation Prevents Unecessary Foster Care

Since 2011, New York State's numbers of children entering into foster care has plummeted 41%. Meanwhile, the number of children entering foster care in Montana has gone up by 49%. So why is this? What has contributed to New York's success? Does this have anything to do with the way some states have used their state and federal funding?

With the Family First Preservation Services Act being passed in 2020, federal funding will become more widely available to states to spend on family preservation services. These services aim to support parents who are struggling to maintain homes that will allow them to keep their children, often due to addiction, financial troubles, meantal health or safety issues. Studies have shown that children suffer from pre-verbal trauma when they are separated from their families. So ultimately, this Act being passed is good, right? Some legislators on the state level in New York, are concerned about this restrictions this poses on borrowing for congregate care, which includes group homes an over-night care for foster children.

This chart will be taking a look at the trends in children entering foster care over time, as well as the number of children who have had parental rights terminated. These numbers will be correlated with the amount of money spent at the state and federal levels.

I'll be working with datasets from childwelgare.gov, the AFCARS reports, and childtrends.org. There are yearly reports from 2011 to 2020 from AFCARS on foster children trends. There is data every other year from 2008 to 2018 on federal and state spending on childwelfare.gov. However, I have not been able to source information for every state for 2014 and 2016, so what I may do is the math for a percentage change in spending from 2012 to 2018. For the AFCARS data, I'll only look at the changes from 2012 to 2018 to keep the data consistent with each other.
