      <p>By Amanda Kari McHugh</p>
      <p>Since 2011, New York State's numbers of children entering into foster care has plummeted by 41%. Meanwhile, the number of children entering into foster care in Montana has gone up by 49%. If we look at the trends in state and federal
        spending from these states, various aspects of family preservation spending have had a direct correlation. If we look at what often causes children to be separated from their families – mental health issues, addiction, lack of
        childcare and unfit living conditions – it can be boiled down to a class issue. Family preservation services aim to balance the scales to give parents a fighting chance at keeping their kids.</p>
      <p>A common concern that often arises around this concept is whether or not staying with the parents is best for the child. According to the Adoption Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (<a
          href=https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cb/afcarsreport27.pdf>AFCARS</a>) 63% of children are removed from their families because of neglect. Childwelfare.gov defines neglect of a child as "failure of a parent or
        other person with responsibility for the child to provide needed food, clothing, shelter, medical care, or supervision to the degree that the child's health, safety, and well-being are threatened with harm." The second most common
        reason at 34% is parental drug abuse. After children are separated from their parents they have a certain amount of time to change the circumstances that had them taken away in the first place, and that length of time differs for
        every state. It's at this point that family preservation services come into play. So how effective is family preservation?

      <p><iframe title="Percent Change in Parental Rights Terminated since 2011" aria-label="Interactive line chart" id="datawrapper-chart-zXtKm" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/zXtKm/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="600"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();
</script>
      <p>This success rate can most clearly be seen if we look at the changes in whether or not a parent's rights to their children were terminated. The chart above shows the percent change in rights terminated over time from 2011 to 2020,
        looking at the top and bottom five states. Here you'll notice that North Dakota had the highest increase in termination at 187% and Wyoming had the greatest decrease at 68%. In 2014, Wyoming had the greatest dip in terminations going
        down by 80% - and that same year federal spending per child for the state's child welfare system went up to $142 per child from $80 in 2012. Meanwhile, North Dakota's terminations increased by 32% and their federal spending per child
        increased by only 1%.</p>
      <p>This can make a case that when money is spent on Child Welfare services in general, and the federal government helps supply those funds, the goal of keeping families together becomes more possible. It's difficult to pin down exactly
        what percent of those funds went into family preservation services, however, as no one stream of funding was specifically dedicated to this during this time. With the <a
          href=https://ocfs.ny.gov/programs/fostercare/titleiv-e/#:~:text=Information%20System%20Messages-,What%20is%20Title%20IV%2DE%3F,meet%20specified%20federal%20eligibility%20requirements>Family First Preservation Services Act</a> being
        passed in 2018, federal funding opened up new avenues for funding, most notably through Title IV-E. This was originally part of the amendments to the Social Security Act in 1980 to allow for states and tribes to claim federal
        reimbursement for foster care and adoption services.</p>
      <p>With the passing of this new bill, the <a href=https://www.ncsl.org/research/human-services/family-first-prevention-services-act-ffpsa.aspx>National Congress of State Legislatures</a> states that states and tribes will now, "have the
        option to use these funds for prevention services that would allow "candidates for foster care" to stay with their parents or relatives. States will be reimbursed for prevention services for up to 12 months."</P>
